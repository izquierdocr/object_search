/// Perform actions when keyboard keys are pressed
/**
   This class is used for handling input from the keyboard.
   Use addKeyHandler() to associate a functor with a keyboard key.
   ArKeyHandler will call that functor when the key is pressed.

   You should also register the keyhandler with Aria::setKeyHandler(),
   and before you create a key handler you should see if one is
   already there with Aria::getKeyHandler().  Only one key handler
   can be created in a program, and this lets independent parts
   of a program use the same key handler.
   
   You can attach a key handler to a robot with
   ArRobot::attachKeyHandler() which will put a task into the robots
   list of tasks to check for new keyboard input in each cycle, and which
   will also add a handler to end the robot's task cycle when Escape is pressed
   (you can override this by replacing it with your own handler).
   If you have mulitple ArRobot objects, only create one key handler and attach
   it to one robot.

   Alternatively, you can call checkKeys() periodically to check for new key input.
